# 05 — Memory (lessons)

**Contract**
- **Role:** the topic registry for durable lessons.
- **Mutability:** the registry is updated in place; the shards it points at are
  append-only.
- **Read when:** before touching anything non-obvious.
- **Update when:** a hard-won gotcha, a surprising failure, or a reversed assumption.

**Why this file exists:** the same mistake is rediscovered, at full cost, every
time it is not written down. This is the cheapest place to put it.

**Harness memory is not this.** A harness may keep its own memory (per user,
outside the repository). Project lessons go here, where every agent and every
harness reads them; harness memory holds only the user's personal preferences.
Never record a project lesson in both.
