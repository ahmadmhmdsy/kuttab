# 09 — Decision records

**Contract**
- **Role:** one file per accepted decision, with its context and consequences.
- **Mutability:** frozen once accepted. A reversal is a **new** record that
  supersedes the old one; the old record is never rewritten.
- **Read when:** before reversing a design choice, or when wondering "why is
  it like this?"
- **Update when:** a significant, hard-to-reverse decision is made.

**Why this file exists:** without it, every agent re-opens settled questions and
sometimes wins.

---

## What belongs here

A decision belongs here when at least one is true:

- it is expensive or slow to reverse;
- it constrains future options;
- it was contested;
- a reasonable future agent would ask "why not the other way?"

Do **not** record routine implementation choices. They belong in the code.

## Index

| ID | Title | Status | Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0002 | [Live tutor: agent-led sessions with voice, board and researched tracks](0002-live-tutor.md) | accepted | 2026-10-24 |
| 0001 | [Teacher tools are built-in plugins](0001-teacher-tools-as-plugins.md) | accepted | 2026-10-18 |

`0000-template.md` is a form, not an entry; it never appears in the index above.

## Naming

    NNNN-short-title.md

Four digits, zero-padded, never reused. Supersede by writing a new record whose
**Supersedes** field names the old one, and by marking the old record's status
as superseded with a link forward.

## Workflow

1. Copy docs/09-decisions/0000-template.md to NNNN-short-title.md.
2. Fill every section. A section with no content gets "none" — not deletion.
3. Add a row to the index above.
4. If the decision changes a rule or a spec, update those in the same commit.
