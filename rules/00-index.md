# rules/ — normative rule modules

This directory is the **authoritative rule text** for the project. This file is
the **registry of its modules**: the directory holds the authoritative text,
this index registers every module, and the root `AGENTS.md` router points at
them. Where a module and any other file disagree about a rule, the module wins
and both are fixed in the same commit.

## Contract

- **Mutability:** approval-only. A rule changes deliberately, never as a
  side effect of another task.
- **Precedence:** a module outranks CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and everything in
  docs/ for the area it governs. Only system and platform safety outrank these.
- **Scope:** one module per governed area. If a rule does not fit an existing
  module, either it belongs in an existing one or a new area is genuinely
  emerging — and then the new module is added here in the same commit.

## Rule IDs

Every rule carries an ID of the form **R-NN.M**, where NN is the module number
and M is the rule number inside it.

- Module 03, rule 2 -> **R-03.2**.
- Cite rules by ID from any other document: "see R-03.2".
- IDs are stable. Do not renumber to close a gap; retire a rule with
  *(retired)* and its reason, so old citations stay resolvable.

## Strength keywords

- **MUST** / **MUST NOT** — absolute. Violating it is a defect, not a tradeoff.
- **SHOULD** / **SHOULD NOT** — the default. Deviating requires a stated reason
  in the report.
- **MAY** — genuinely optional.

**Protected** marks a module that is never deleted when adapting; a `no` module
may be deleted when it cannot apply.

## Adapting this directory

Delete modules that cannot apply to your project. **Do not delete** modules
03, 04, 08, 11, 12, or 16 — every project has destructive actions, secrets,
verification, permissions, the possibility of a second writer, and scoped
entry files.

A rule nobody can violate is noise, and noise trains agents to skim rules.
